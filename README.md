# bebop_teleop
ROS node for the Parrot Bebop (1/2) teleop

To install and run this, you'll need `SDL 2`, which you may have to install (`libsdl2-dev`), and `SDL_TTF`. To install this node, clone this repo into a catkin workspace's `src` directory (preferably a new/clean one), and run `$ catkin_make`.
